## **MongoDB**

If you don't have MongoDB running locally, follow the next steps:

1. Open `mongod` on your local device.

2. Your MongoDB should be available under the following host:
   ```sh
   mongodb://localhost:27017
   ```

By default, the event-service connects to MongoDB on `localhost:27017` and creates a new database called `events-db`.
